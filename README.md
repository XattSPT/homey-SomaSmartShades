# SOMA Smart Shade for Homey

## Introduction
This app integrate the `SOMA Smart Shade` into Homey.

## Q&amp;A

> **Q1**  Why canâ€™t Soma Smart Shade be found by Homey?

* _Check if the SOMA Smart Shade is not connected to another bluetooth device. The  `SomaSmartShade`  app for example_

> **Q2**  Is the app compatibel with v2.0.0?

* The app is only compatible from v2.1.2 and up due to change to the BLE core.

## Usage ##
1. Install app
2. Add device(s) to Homey.
3. Make a flow with one of the cards.

You can configure the timeout between polls in the app's settings.

Also is possible to connect to MQTT-Broker if you enable on settings.
It publish following messages for a SomaShade (RISEXXX):

    - SomaShades/RISEXXX/position/value (where value is between 0.00 and 1.00)
    
    - SomaShades/RISEXXX/battery/value (where value is between 0 and 100)
    
    - SomaSahdes/RISEXXX/state/value  (where value is up/idle/down)

You can also Subscribe to a Topic and move SomaShades to a value.

    - SomaShades/+/REVECIVE/value (where RECEIVE can be configured on settings)
